    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Lane tracking and keeping systems have started to appear on commercial vehicles lately. Even though its development started long ago, it has only been a couple of years since its application has become commercially available. This technology not only detects lanes but also makes sure that the vehicle remains centered on the lane while driving. This is presents quite a different scenario to commonly known lane departure systems, which alert the driver when its leaning towards an edge on the lanes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the problem of keeping a vehicle centered within lanes is no easy task. Therefore, the problem must be broken down into smaller problems that can be easily tackled by themselves. Two key components of the system are lane tracking systems and lane keeping systems. Furthermore, lane tracking systems consist on lane detection systems and filters such as Particle filters and Kalman filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "On previous lab reports, the problem of detecting lanes was thoroughly solved. However, this final project required to develop filters for tracking the lanes and control strategies for keeping the vehicle centered while moving forward. For tracking purposes, a Kalman Filter was used and for control purposes a PID control loop was implemented.\n"

    "### 1. Basis\n",
    "\n",
    "The Raspberry Pi 3B+ (RPi for short) is the brains on the vehicle. It will run the lane detection algorithms as well as the control algorithms for the motors and a web server for live monitoring and control of the vehicle. A STM32 microcontroller will aid the the RPi through serial communication by interfacing with the H-Bridge, reading the batteries' voltages, and providing some basic user feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons behind using a STM32 microcontroller for the reasons mentioned before are varied. The main one relies on moving all IO operations outside of the Raspberry Pi to focus its work on the lane detection algorithms and web server. Furthermore, it adds a layer of protection between the RPi and the outside world. Finally, since the STM32 microcontroller runs at 3.3V its the perfect match for the RPi."

    "#### 1.2 Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is to create a network hotspot on a laptop to which the Raspberry Pi is going to connect. The Raspberry Pi will be running its server locally and will try to connect automatically to the network every time it is in range. Doing so allows for a constant server operation and whenever a connection is lost or the hotspot isn't running, the server keeps on running looking for any connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the created hotspot will be a bridged hotspot between any available wireless networks connected on the laptop. This means that whenever the RPi connects to the hotspot it will automatically gain internet access to the Internet. This implies that a second wireless card must be used. In my case, the internal wifi card of the laptop was used for Internet access and a external Etekcity 300 Mbps 2.4Ghz SI-7200ND wireless adapter was used for the hotspot creation.\n",

   "source": [
    "The main working principle behind the lane keeping system relies on the idea that for a system that estimates the lane position via a first order polynomial, the position of the lanes will always be the same when the vehicle's position is centered on the lanes. This true regardless on the lane curvature. Since the vehicle is moving at a slow speed, such an estimate can be made and produces reliable results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following image shows in white the center position of the lanes, and in yellow and cyan the currently detect lanes. Since the vehicle is relatively centered, the position of the detected and centered lanes is about the same.\n",

    "In the following image, the vehicle turned suddenly to the right. Therefore, the detected lanes are to the left from the centered lines. By measuring the -x distance from the tip of the centered lanes to the tip of the detected lanes, an indication of how much the vehicle has departed from the center can be estimated.\n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of the lane keeping system consisted on the successful development of its core components measured at the beginning of this project. One of the biggest struggles for this project where the lane tracking and control systems. A naive approach was taken at first, which consisted on calculating the intersection point between the detected lanes and measuring the deviation from the image center. This deviation would be the input to the PID and must be minimized to zero. Nonetheless, this proved to result unsuccessful. When the vehicle is turning the center of the image moves slightly to the turning side and the vehicle slowly starts to lean towards this edge until it completely goes over the lane. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a more complex algorithm was proposed. For this, data and video was recovered from manual control tests and it was found that the detected lanes tend to follow a normal distribution. This meant that they have a mean value and that they could be filtered via a Kalman Filter. Further analysis proved that by trying to keep the vehicle centered on the mean values for the lanes would also mean that the vehicle would remain centered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing this algorithm required going a step further than what was though in this course. A Kalman Filter was a key aspect for this project to work. Itâs such a powerful filter with a lot of versatility. It allowed to filter outliers and produced a smooth lane detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "A limiting factor for the performance of this vehicle was the physical construction. The vehicle is a two-wheeled robot with a caster wheel on front. By having this construction type, any debris found on the track caused the vehicle to jump and turn at the same time. This made it harder to control the vehicle and limited the speed at which the vehicle could be driven. The maximum speed for reliable results was 40%. At this speed the vehicle was capable of driving around the track with no errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a recommendation, a four wheeled robot would be a better design choice for this kind of vehicle. Finally, a more complex algorithm for detecting lanes would be desirable. By estimating a second degree polynomial and the lane curvature, the vehicle can be better centered. However, doing so would result in a completely different implementation to what was thought throughout this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, I believe what was achieved with the knowledge learned in this course and the implementation of a Kalman Filter produced great results. This is the last class in my bachelorâs degree, and it has allowed me to practice everything that I have learned on previous semesters."
