    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Object segmentation in images or video can be done by selecting the pixels with similar color. This can be useful in several applications. For instance, in autonomous vehicles, object segmentation could be used to identify traffic lights, traffic lanes, traffic signs, and many other objects; all of them uniquely identified by their color. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difficulty when performing object segmentation is lighting. When lightning changes, colors can be perceived darker or lighter, therefore producing different shades, tints, and tones of the same hue. Normally, cameras provide images in the RGB color space (BGR for OpenCV). The main disadvantage of this color space is that lightning affects the three components of the color (red, green, blue), and therefore, it becomes difficult to select a range of colors programmatically. Another alternative must be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "HSV is another color space that is composed of three variables:\n",
    "- hue: pure color it resembles. All shades, tones, and tints of the of x color have the same hue.\n",
    "- saturation: describes how white the color is. Pure red is fully saturated. Meanwhile, white has a saturation of 0.\n",
    "- value: also called lightness, describes how dark the color is. A value of 0 means black.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the HSV color space, when lighting changes, the hue component remains constant for the most part. This advantage makes it easy to select hues under different lighting conditions. For this reason, it is used as a robust alternative to the RGB color space for object segmentation."

    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn about image colour space, particularly about the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) and HLS (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) colour maps. You will use this colour space to segment an object in a video sequence, this object can be either a fish swimming in a fishbolw, lane lines on a road, or any other object that can be segmented by using its corresponding HSV components."

    "\n",
    "In conclusion, working in the RGB color space isnât that robust as working in the HSV color space. The main advantage is presented when the lighting changes. In the RGB color space, when the amount of light varies, different shades of the same color are perceived and represented in three variables (red, green, and blue). These three variables can change completely even through they could represent the same hue under different light conditions. This situation doesnât happen under the HSV color space. The hue is maintained under different lighting conditions. Therefore, when segmenting colors is a required task, the HSV color space is ideal."
